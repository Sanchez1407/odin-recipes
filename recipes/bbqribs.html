            <h2> Description </h2>
            

            <p><strong>Homemade rib marinade</strong> is used in this barbecue ribs recipe that's <em>easier</em> than it looks. 
                I usually cook the ribs the day before and grill them for a <em>quick</em> dinner the next night. 
                <strong>The sauce</strong> is much better after it is cooked; it is not a dipping sauce.</p>
            <p>Besides, if you are the kind of person who likes including <em>sweet flavors</em> on your food,
                this recipe will <strong>satisfy you</strong>.</p>
