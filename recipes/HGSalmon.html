              <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
              
               <h4>Sauce</h4>
                  <ul>
                   
                    <li>4 tbsp honey</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp soy sauce (all purpose or light soy sauce)</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp white vinegar (or sub with any other vinegar except balsamic)</li>
                    <li>1 large garlic clove (or 2 small), minced</li>
                 
                  </ul>
                 
                 <h4>Salmon</h4>
                    
                   <ul>
                     
                     <li>2 salmon or trout fillets, skinless (60oz/200g each)</li>
                     <li>Olive oil</li>
                     <li>Salt</li>
                     <li>Pepper</li>
                   
                    </ul>  



              <h3>Steps</h3>

                <ol>
                    
                    <li>Have the salmon out of the fridge 25 minutes before cooking.</li>
                    <li>Mix the Sauce ingredients in a small bowl.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle oil in a non stick fry pan and heat over medium high heat 
                        (or just under, if your stove runs hot). 
                        Place salmon in the pan, and cook the first side for 3 or 4 minutes until golden. 
                        Turn, then cook the other side for 2 or 3 minutes or until golden.</li>
                    <li>Pour Sauce over salmon. Cook for 1 minute or until it starts to thicken slightly. 
                        Check the side of the salmon to tell how cooked 
                        through the middle is 
                        – I like mine medium rare inside. However, if Sauce thickens too much 
                        before your salmon is cooked to your taste, just add water 1 tbsp at a time.</li>
                    <li>Remove onto serving plates.</li>
                    <li>Serve salmon drizzled with Sauce, sprinkled with sesame seeds and chives/shallots, if desired.</li>
                   
                </ol>
