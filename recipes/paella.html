                    <li>Heat olive oil in paella pan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and pepper; cook and stir for a few minutes. Add chorizo sausage, diced chicken, and rice; cook for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>

                        If the rice is uncooked, stir in ½ cup more stock. 
                        Continue cooking, stirring occasionally. Stir in additional stock if necessary: use up to 2 cups additional stock, 5 cups total.
