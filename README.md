# odin-recipes introduction 

Hi there users!, I'm a programming learner and this project consists on building a functional recipes website to test my HTML and Git skills which have been learned by me during my foundations path on "The Odin Project".

# Skills

-Building a website using headings, paragraghs, images, lists and links using HTML 5.

-Understand the git basics and its workflow by cloning my github repo on my local machine and also generating commit messages to keep my git log ordered as well as my github log. Thus, i prepare myself to collaborate with my future coworkers as well.
